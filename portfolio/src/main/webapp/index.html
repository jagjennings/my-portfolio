      <p>My name is Jag Jennings and I will be going into my Junior Year at XULA this Fall.</p>
 
      <p>
        I am currently a Sophomore at Xavier University in New Orleans, pursuing a degree in Computer Science. I have
        participated in several Computer Science oriented summer programs, including Google’s Engineering Practicum
        Internship, Google's Computer Science Summer Institute and the University of California, Irvine’s ASPIRE
        program. I have also taken various online courses in both Python and Java, including AP Computer Science A
        through Edhesive.com and Introduction to iOS Mobile App Development through Edmentum.com.
      </p>
 
      <p>
        I graduated Summa Cum Laude from Mater Dei High School in California with a 4.4 GPA. Over the course of my high
        school career, I took 10 Advanced Placement Classes with a 100% passing rate, for which I have been awarded the
        title of AP Scholar with Honor by College Board. I have also spent the last four years studying both the
        language and culture of China, taking Mandarin Chinese classes at both Mater Dei and Saddleback College. I have
        continued to enhance my Mandarin proficiency in college, and I currently act as a Student Ambassador for the
        US-China Strong Foundation, encouraging Americans throughout the country to study Chinese.
      </p>
 
      <p>
        In addition to my Computer Science and Mandarin Chinese experience, I possess proficient math skills and take
        pleasure in problem-solving and critical thinking. I also have a significant understanding of Civil Engineering
        through my studies of 3-D design softwares Sketchup, AutoCAD, and SolidWorks.
